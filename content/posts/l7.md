# lecture 7 chapter 8 component based thinking

how architect think about components

how architect decompose system into components

# component based thinking

## module

structure that is assigned some specific computational responsibilities that form the basis of work assignments for programming teams

how can we divide work up among our development teams

## component

principal unit of computation

could be a lot of things, peer, client, server etc.

## explain

typically as architect, we think more in terms of components than physical modules

# components = physical manifestation of a module ???

like code binaries

modules = physical code

developers physically package modules, jar for Java, dll for .NET, gem for Ruby

# different varieties of components

we can have different forms of components

wrapper of code = library (grouping of classes and functions)

layer of subsystem, larger, but still cohesive

-   system = composition of subsystems

event processor, process message, respond to event

distributed service, tend to run on its own address space

-   typically communicate through low level protocol, TCP/IP, REST

-   we like to package things as services because they can be deployed in a much more distributed manner than something like libraries

all this to say components come in different shapes and sizes

# component scope

architect don't have to use components

if our code is small, simple, we don't have to make big clunky architecture to handle it

# role of the architect

software architect often collaborate with business analysts, subject matter experts, developers, etc.

we want to build out of bricks, not out of straws, carefully consider fundamental building blocks of our software, which are componentsS

architect consider how to decompose and partition components

architect define, refine, manage, governs components, they are the first to initially define what the components of a system is going to be

# architecture in development process

architect is independent from development process

-   exception, in agile when development process and architect process can be tightly coupled

components are lowest level of software system

component are usually classes or functions

-   but architect usually does not design classes, technical leads usually design and apply design patterns

-   architect shouldn't try to micro manage the design process of software from top to bottom, they should rely and collaborate with their team to do this in an efficient manner

# architecture partitioning

first law of software architecture, everything is a trade off

before we identify components, we partition architecture

components are general containership mechanism

different styles of partitioning comes with different set of trade-offs

depends on different software, we will require different trade-offs

# top level architecture partitioning: layered and modular

layered monolith vs modular monolith

## layered monolith

made of layers, they each are some grouping of containers

## modular monolith

instead of packaging everything into layers that stacks on top of each other, we pack everything into simple modules that all work with each other

a collection of modules that perform specific tasks

## explain

they are are also one architecture quanta, because they have one component, and one database

they can also have submodules or subsystems, as each of the code blocks in the modular monolith can be complicated enough to have its own modules, or own components

but with regards to the software architecture as a whole, they are considered their components

# technical partitioning

two general styles of partitioning

very much like layered architecture

partitioning functionality of the system into technical capabilities

each layer, its own technical capability

organizing principles is separation of concerns

# but difficult to maintain, and result in higher level of coupling within each components ???

specific to that case, lots of arrows pointing out

# domain partitioning

organize architect using domains, workflows, the different kinds of things the system is performing that are independent and decoupled from each other

workflows are general ways someone might use and interact with system

domain partitioning decomposes complex systems

each components can have their own persistence library and have separate layer for business rules, but top level partitioning revolves around domains

# technical vs domain

domain of checkout smeared across many layers we have, not a good idea

it depends, which things are more changing, which partitioning to use

code for fetching SQL vs code for implementing the SQL database

# silicon sandwiches

# domain

components has subcomponents

components and their interface with other components

# technical

not layered we usually see, but have local, common

also we can have components and subcomponents here too

isolate into technical capabilities as needed

# evaluating domain partitioning

## advantages

closer to biz function

easier to build for teams

align closely to modular monolith, can be distributed microservices

way message flows matches problem domain

easy to migrate data and component to distributed architecture, can use microservices architecture if we choose

## disadvantages

local customization code appear in multiple places

local customization code changes often and per customers, this can be a big disadvantage

# technical partitioning

## advantages

separate customization code

align to layered architecture pattern

## disadvantages

global coupling

have recipes in both command local, changes to either component affect other components, high degree of global coupling

in domain it is easier to see how data are separated, now it is more difficult for the data to be distributed

# choice

domain, common trends in last decade points towards domain

but because it is trend doesn't mean it's rule

for technical, you have common and local easily seen

for domain, you have to fetch everything to know if it is common or local

# check your understanding

## advantage of domain partitioning

more closely related to how business functions

we are partitioning on general workflow, how we actually use the system, and how the system are used

component, each part, solve a problem we have

most cases, realistic software, workflow that cut across technical capabilities, instead of within technical capabilities

## advantage of technical partitioning

more secure system, all the persistence data in database

simpler workflow, simpler system, better to use technical

instead of decomposing a single workflow into multiple workflows

support separation of concerns, enable developers to find categories of code quickly
