# lec 1

interaction design is process

# lec 2

UX

accessibility, extent product is accessible for those with disabilities

inclusiveness, fair, open, equal to everyone, smartphones being designed and made available for all

impairments

universal design

-   equitable use

-   flexibility in use

-   simple and intuitive use

-   perceptible information

-   tolerance for error

-   low physical effort

-   size and space for approach and use

usability goals

-   effectiveness

-   efficiency

-   safety

-   utility

-   learnability

-   memorability

design principles

-   visibility

-   feedback

-   constraints

-   consistency

-   affordance

# lec 3 data gathering (heuristics)

heuristic evaluations

-   visibility of system status

-   match between system and real world

-   user control and freedom

-   consistency and standards

-   error prevention

-   recognition rather than recall

-   flexibility and efficiency of use

-   aesthetic and minimalistic design

-   help users with errors

-   help and documentation

severity ratings

-   1 cosmetic

-   2 minor usability

-   3 major usability

-   4 usability catastrophe, fix before release

cognitive walkthrough

-   will the correct action be sufficiently evident to the user

-   will the user notice that the correct action is available

-   will the user associate and interpret the response from the action correctly

pluralistic walkthrough

fitt's law, time to object = distance and object size

# lec 4 data gathering (interviews)

unstructured, structured, semi structured, focus groups

closed questions, open questions

avoid long, jargon, "why do you like", biases

running the interview

-   introduction

-   warm-up

-   main body

-   cool-off period

-   closure

props

surveys

likert, measure of agreement

online questionnaire, data cleaning, undetermined sample size, responding more than once

# lec 6 data gathering (observation) (week 4 1)

direct, influence participants

indirect, far, creepy

who, where, what

usability testing, testing device, not participants

between subjects, different groups

within subjects, same group

pairwise, matched participants

# lec 7 qualitive data analysis (codes) (week 4 2)

qualitative, themes, patterns, stories

deductive, identify themes from data

inductive, categorize data into themes

analyze critical incidents

cohen's kappa

| value of kappa | level of agreement |
| -------------- | ------------------ |
| 0-.20          | none               |
| .21-39         | minimal            |
| .40-59         | weak               |
| .60-.79        | moderate           |
| .80-.90        | strong             |
| above .90      | almost perfect     |

thematic analysis

-   gather data

-   read data

-   code text

-   evaluate theme for good fit

theme, important about data in relation to study goal

code, word or phrase that act as label for segment of text

descriptive, interpretive code

grounded theory

-   open, identify categories

-   axial, flex out and link to subcategories

-   selective, form theoretical scheme

# lec 8 quantitative data analysis (week 5 1)

mean, median, mode

histogram

boxplot

bar graph

scatterplot

line graph

heatmap

hypothesis, null hypothesis p < 0.05, reject null

# hypothesis

null hypothesis, there is no difference

if p `<` 0.05, reject null hypothesis

`p` is probability of event happening by chance

example: text based vs image based passwords

null hypothesis, there is no difference

independent variables we control, dependent variables we observe, don't control

types of variables

-   nominal, categories, gender

-   ordinal, likert scale responses, age groups

-   continuous, time, # errors

# which test to use

first column, normal distribution

second column, not normal distribution

third column, two choices

paired, two groups that are same

black, between subject

white, within subject

|                       | normality assumed | normality not assumed, ordinal | binomial |
| --------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------ | -------- |
| between groups        |
| within groups         |
| between 2 more groups |
| within 2 more groups  |

fairness

accountability, accurate & correct

transparency, decisions made by system visible

explainability, can people understand

# lec 9 ID process (week 5 2)

a process focused on users

measure user's reactions

iterative design

user/stakeholders

# lec 10 ID process (week 6 1)
