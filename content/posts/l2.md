# chapter 4 architecture characteristics defined

# architecture characteristic

-   describes a concern critical to the success of the architecture

-   like non functional but more important

-   not usually in requirements, but can be in

## non domain design consideration

-   certain level of performance for the application

-   not written in requirements

## influences some structural aspect of design

-   security, influences structure

## critical or important to application success

-   fewest most possible

# explicit vs implicit

## explicit characteristic

-   characteristic that appears in requirements documentation

## implicit characteristic

-   characteristic necessary for project success, but does not appear in requirements documentation

-   ex. availability, reliability, security, not business language

# architecture characteristics categories

## operational

-   performance, scalability, elasticity, availability, and reliability

## structural

-   code structure, modularity, readable code

## cross-cutting

-   fall outside yet are important

# arch char table

## operational

these are how well the funitures in the room functions

| term               | def                                                     |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| availability       | system up time                                          |
| continuity         | recovery from disaster                                  |
| performance        | stress testing, frequency of functions used             |
| recoverability     | biz req, with disaster, how quick is system back online |
| reliability/safety | system fail safe, mission critical                      |
| robustness         | handle error                                            |
| scalability        | perform as number of users increases                    |

## structural

these are more about the structural, aka, shape of the software, how funitures are arranged in the room

| term                    | def                                                      |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| configurability         | ability for users to easily change software config       |
| ! extensibility         | how important to plug new functionality in               |
| installability          | ease of system install on all platforms                  |
| ! leverageability/reuse | leverage common components across multiple products      |
| localization            | support multiple languages, currencies                   |
| ! maintainability       | how easy to apply changes and enhance system             |
| portability             | does system need to run on more than one platform        |
| ! supportability        | level of technical support, logging required to debug    |
| upgradeability          | ability to upgrade from prev vers on servers and clients |

## cross-cutting

| term                    | def                                                      |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| accessibility           | access for users with colorblindness or hearing loss     |
| archivability           | archived to separate database                            |
| authentication          | security req for login                                   |
| authorization           | security req for users access only certain functions     |
| legal                   | legislative constraint system operate in                 |
| privacy                 | hide transactions from internal employees                |
| security                | data encrypted on database, network comms, remote access |
| supportability          | level of technical support, logging required to debug    |
| usability/achievability | ability to upgrade from prev vers on servers and clients |

# chapter 5 identifying architecture characteristics

collaborate with problem domain stakeholders to determine what is truly important from domain perspective

# kata

## description

-   domain problem the system is trying to solve

## users

-   the numbers/types of users

## requirements

-   domain level requirements

## additional context

-   implicit knowledge of problem domain

# silicon sandwiches

## desc

national sandwich shop wants online ordering

## users

thousands, one day millions

## requirements

users place order, traffic mapping services

-   reliability

mobile accessibility

-   performance, portability

promotions, specials

-   customizability

online payment

-   security

franchised

-   feasibility

expand overseas

-   internationalization, localization

## implicit

security

customizability

# room with a view

## desc

hotel reservation and management system

## explicit

system web based and made via web

guests and hotel staff

-   peak season more people, scalability

-   availability, performance

book types of room with pictures

-   customizability

room status

-   availability

direct to devices attached to cleaning carts

-   want to plug new connections to hardware in, extensibility

upgrade on existing

-   usability

## implicit

security, for payments

authorization, hotel staff sees different view than users

it is a hotel, has locations around the world, localization
