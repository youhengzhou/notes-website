code</p><p>developers physically package modules, jar for Java, dll for .NET, gem for Ruby</p><h1 id=different-varieties-of-components>different varieties of components</h1><p>we can have different forms of components</p><p>wrapper of code = library (grouping of classes and functions)</p><p>layer of subsystem, larger, but still cohesive</p><ul><li>system = composition of subsystems</li></ul><p>event processor, process message, respond to event</p><p>distributed service, tend to run on its own address space</p><ul><li><p>typically communicate through low level protocol, TCP/IP, REST</p></li><li><p>we like to package things as services because they can be deployed in a much more distributed manner than something like libraries</p></li></ul><p>all this to say components come in different shapes and sizes</p><h1 id=component-scope>component scope</h1><p>architect don&rsquo;t have to use components</p><p>if our code is small, simple, we don&rsquo;t have to make big clunky architecture to handle it</p><h1 id=role-of-the-architect>role of the architect</h1><p>software architect often collaborate with business analysts, subject matter experts, developers, etc.</p><p>we want to build out of bricks, not out of straws, carefully consider fundamental building blocks of our software, which are componentsS</p><p>architect consider how to decompose and partition components</p><p>architect define, refine, manage, governs components, they are the first to initially define what the components of a system is going to be</p><h1 id=architecture-in-development-process>architecture in development process</h1><p>architect is independent from development process</p><ul><li>exception, in agile when development process and architect process can be tightly coupled</li></ul><p>components are lowest level of software system</p><p>component are usually classes or functions</p><ul><li><p>but architect usually does not design classes, technical leads usually design and apply design patterns</p></li><li><p>architect shouldn&rsquo;t try to micro manage the design process of software from top to bottom, they should rely and collaborate with their team to do this in an efficient manner</p></li></ul><h1 id=architecture-partitioning>architecture partitioning</h1><p>first law of software architecture, everything is a trade off</p><p>before we identify components, we partition architecture</p><p>components are general containership mechanism</p><p>different styles of partitioning comes with different set of trade-offs</p><p>depends on different software, we will require different trade-offs</p><h1 id=top-level-architecture-partitioning-layered-and-modular>top level architecture partitioning: layered and modular</h1><p>layered monolith vs modular monolith</p><h2 id=layered-monolith>layered monolith</h2><p>made of layers, they each are some grouping of containers</p><h2 id=modular-monolith>modular monolith</h2><p>instead of packaging everything into layers that stacks on top of each other, we pack everything into simple modules that all work with each other</p><p>a collection of modules that perform specific tasks</p><h2 id=explain-1>explain</h2><p>they are are also one architecture quanta, because they have one component, and one database</p><p>they can also have submodules or subsystems, as each of the code blocks in the modular monolith can be complicated enough to have its own modules, or own components</p><p>but with regards to the software architecture as a whole, they are considered their components</p><h1 id=technical-partitioning>technical partitioning</h1><p>two general styles of partitioning</p><p>very much like layered architecture</p><p>partitioning functionality of the system into technical capabilities</p><p>each layer, its own technical capability</p><p>organizing principles is separation of concerns</p><h1 id=but-difficult-to-maintain-and-result-in-higher-level-of-coupling-within-each-components->but difficult to maintain, and result in higher level of coupling within each components ???</h1><p>specific to that case, lots of arrows pointing out</p><h1 id=domain-partitioning>domain partitioning</h1><p>organize architect using domains, workflows, the different kinds of things the system is performing that are independent and decoupled from each other</p><p>workflows are general ways someone might use and interact with system</p><p>domain partitioning decomposes complex systems</p><p>each components can have their own persistence library and have separate layer for business rules, but top level partitioning revolves around domains</p><h1 id=technical-vs-domain>technical vs domain</h1><p>domain of checkout smeared across many layers we have, not a good idea</p><p>it depends, which things are more changing, which partitioning to use</p><p>code for fetching SQL vs code for implementing the SQL database</p><h1 id=silicon-sandwiches>silicon sandwiches</h1><h1 id=domain>domain</h1><p>components has subcomponents</p><p>components and their interface with other components</p><h1 id=technical>technical</h1><p>not layered we usually see, but have local, common</p><p>also we can have components and subcomponents here too</p><p>isolate into technical capabilities as needed</p><h1 id=evaluating-domain-partitioning>evaluating domain partitioning</h1><h2 id=advantages>advantages</h2><p>closer to biz function</p><p>easier to build for teams</p><p>align closely to modular monolith, can be distributed microservices</p><p>way message flows matches problem domain</p><p>easy to migrate data and component to distributed architecture, can use microservices architecture if we choose</p><h2 id=disadvantages>disadvantages</h2><p>local customization code appear in multiple places</p><p>local customization code changes often and per customers, this can be a big disadvantage</p><h1 id=technical-partitioning-1>technical partitioning</h1><h2 id=advantages-1>advantages</h2><p>separate customization code</p><p>align to layered architecture pattern</p><h2 id=disadvantages-1>disadvantages</h2><p>global coupling</p><p>have recipes in both command local, changes to either component affect other components, high degree of global coupling</p><p>in domain it is easier to see how data are separated, now it is more difficult for the data to be distributed</p><h1 id=choice>choice</h1><p>domain, common trends in last decade points towards domain</p><p>but because it is trend doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s rule</p><p>for technical, you have common and local easily seen</p><p>for domain, you have to fetch everything to know if it is common or local</p><h1 id=check-your-understanding>check your understanding</h1><h2 id=advantage-of-domain-partitioning>advantage of domain partitioning</h2><p>more closely related to how business functions</p><p>we are partitioning on general workflow, how we actually use the system, and how the system are used</p><p>component, each part, solve a problem we have</p><p>most cases, realistic software, workflow that cut across technical capabilities, instead of within technical capabilities</p><h2 id=advantage-of-technical-partitioning>advantage of technical partitioning</h2><p>more secure system, all the persistence data in database</p><p>simpler workflow, simpler system, better to use technical</p><p>instead of decomposing a single workflow into multiple workflows</p><p>support separation of concerns, enable developers to find categories of code quickly</p></section><nav class="mt-24 flex rounded-lg bg-black/[3%] p-1.5 text-lg dark:bg-white/[8%]"><a class="flex w-1/2
